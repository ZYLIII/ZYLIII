One fact about yourself: Keeping pets is one of my hobbies. Two cats and one dog make my life full of fun.

Interest in IT 

I watched The Matrix when I was a child, and then I thought the colorful computer code interface was too excellent, so I wanted to be the kind of hacker who could be like the one in the movie. Although I scratch my scalp stupidly facing a few lines of code every day, it will give me a great sense of accomplishment after completing a program. 

Furthermore, my interest in gaming has sparked my interest in IT. There are often many cheaters in some games, so normal players have no game experience. I want to contribute to the anti-cheat program in the future.

I chose RMIT because it is located in the city center, which is very convenient for travel and daily life. IT is an excellent course in RMIT, and the employment rate is also very high.I would like to learn something about data science and cybersecurity at RMIT.

The results of these tests have allowed me to understand myself better and that I am a very introverted person. In a team, I should be bolder to communicate with others, express my thoughts more, and become more outgoing, instead of not communicating with others. When forming a team, it is very important to be good at communication, each doing their own things without communication is not a team at all. Only by discussing, expressing and accepting opinions together and working together is an excellent team.
