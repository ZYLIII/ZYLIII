<p>One fact about yourself: Keeping pets is one of my hobbies. Two cats and one dog make my life full of fun.</p>

<p>Interest in IT </p>

<p>I watched The Matrix when I was a child, and then I thought the colorful computer code interface was too excellent, so I wanted to be the kind of hacker who could be like the one in the movie. Although I scratch my scalp stupidly facing a few lines of code every day, it will give me a great sense of accomplishment after completing a program. </p>
